About LittleGame

Hi. This is LittleGame. But actually, it has another name, which for now has to remain a secret. LittleGame is a project that is in constant change. I use it to test game design ideas, code ideas and stuff in general. I also use to develop projects on the go. I call it LittleGame because it helps me remembering that keeping things small and simple is essential. I also have been using this as my first 100 Days of Code repo, which is pretty cool. That's about it. Feel free to use this code anyway you want to, and if you really like it and wanna see me real happy, give me some credit or send me a message. Thank you very much.
